## AS3 Schema Validator

The AS3 validator is an offline tool to validate AS3 declarations. This tool also validates the AS3 declaration is a valid JSON object.

**Important**: The validator is specific to an AS3 release. This means this validator for one version will not validate other versions of AS3 correctly. For more information on versioning, see https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/blob/master/SUPPORT.md.

There are currently validators for AS3 version 3.5.1 and 3.5.0, and AS3 3.6.0.  Click the appropriate version folder in this directory and use the README file to download and install the validator.  Once the validator is installed, use the **Help** tab for instructions on using the validator.
