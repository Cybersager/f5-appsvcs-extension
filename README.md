## Introduction
Application Services 3 Extension (AS3) is a flexible, low-overhead mechanism for managing application-specific configurations on a BIG-IP system. AS3 uses a declarative model, meaning you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative commands. 

## Documentation
For instructions on using AS3, including download and installation instructions, see https://clouddocs.f5.com/products/extensions/f5-appsvcs-extension

## Filing Issues and Getting Help
If you come across a bug or other issue when using AS3, use [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/F5Networks/f5-appsvcs-extension/issues) to submit an issue for our team.

Because AS3 is has been created and fully tested by F5 Networks, it is fully supported by F5. This means you can get assistance if necessary from [F5 Technical Support](https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K25327565).
